# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add comprehensive keyboard navigation and shortcuts throughout the application to improve accessibility and efficiency for power users.

**Planned changes:**
- Add global keyboard shortcuts for section navigation (Ctrl+1/2/3 for Dairy/Transactions/Settings)
- Add Dairy section tab shortcuts (Ctrl+M/B/D/S/C for Milk Collection/Bill/Data Reports/Sell/Cash)
- Implement Enter key submission for all forms (Milk Collection, Cash, Sell, farmer management, rate settings, inventory)
- Add Escape key support to close all dialogs and modals
- Implement Tab/Shift+Tab navigation with logical focus order through all interactive elements
- Add Ctrl+P shortcut for printing bills and transaction history
- Add visual focus indicators with clear outlines on all interactive elements
- Add keyboard shortcut help overlay accessible via '?' key showing all available shortcuts
- Add arrow key navigation for selecting farmers in search results and transaction lists
- Add Ctrl+F shortcut to focus search inputs in Transactions and Farmer Management sections

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate the entire application, fill forms, manage farmers, and generate reports using only the keyboard. A help overlay ('?' key) displays all available shortcuts. All interactive elements show clear focus indicators, making the application fully accessible via keyboard.
