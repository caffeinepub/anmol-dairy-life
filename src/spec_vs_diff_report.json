  "summary": "The diff successfully implements all three requirements for Enter key navigation in the milk collection form. The implementation adds key handlers for farmer ID (customerID), quantity (weight), and fat fields that move focus between fields and trigger save action as specified. The code preserves existing form submission behavior through the preview/save workflow and includes proper validation checks.",

      "description": "Added Enter key handler for the preview dialog (handleDialogKeyDown) that allows submitting the form via Enter key when the dialog is open",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not specify any keyboard behavior for the preview dialog. The requirements only mention Enter key behavior for the three input fields themselves.",
