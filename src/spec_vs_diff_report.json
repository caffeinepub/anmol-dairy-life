  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to BillGenerator.tsx and index.css that implement PDF generation fixes. The BillGenerator now includes a bill-content div that is hidden on screen but visible during print, containing fully populated bill details including header, farmer info, collection table, and totals. Print styles in index.css show/hide appropriate elements and format the bill layout. The implementation appears to address both REQ-33 (populating bill content) and REQ-34 (print styles), though the diff is truncated so full verification of all acceptance criteria cannot be confirmed.",
